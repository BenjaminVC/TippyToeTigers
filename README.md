# Tippy Toe Tigers ðŸ˜¼ CS 380
<b>Web Programming final assignment</b><br>

Group 3 a.k.a The Tippy Toe Tiger, Charles Biffin, Ben Van Cise, and Jonida Durbaku,  would like to develop a web interface that allows a user to play two games and track their high scores across each game. One game will be the Snake and the other will be the Hangman.The integrated development environment that we are choosing is Visual Studio Code and Docker for providing the server for PHP. SQLite will help us with storing necessary data for the games and usersâ€™ information. We will start with the implementation of our project as soon as our proposal gets approved and after we have created a full idea and design of how our web interface will work out.
